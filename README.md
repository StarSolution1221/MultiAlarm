# MultiAlarm
Multi Alarms is a Python GUI to show a series of alarms that can be set to run simultaneously.
It can set daily alarm or weekly alarm and can add or remove alarm time.
Each alarm plays a configured sound to alert the user with each setting time.



#Background

I wrote Multi-Alarms in 2013 to notify Jewish cultural time alarm.

I then found it generally useful but it lay forgotten in the source code cupboard of my machine as I moved on to other things. So I've created this GitHub repository for it, for posterity.

#Build

pip install -r requirements.txt

I will get to this when I can and anyone interested in helping is very welcome.
